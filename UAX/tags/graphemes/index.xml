      <description>In the unlikely event of a software developer and a typographer attending the same party and—even more unlikely—enganging in some small talk, they certainly are prone to a fundamental disagreement: What is the nature of text? As an IT guy with a heavy interest in typography, I even find me in disagreement with myself, clearly an unhealthy state of mind. As a typographer I may think about beautiful books, fine typecases or craftsmanship in layout, as a bibliophile I may think about inspired literature or enlightened non-fiction, but as a programmer I mainly think of the hassle with UTF-8, emojis, limitations of string libaries and so on.</description>
