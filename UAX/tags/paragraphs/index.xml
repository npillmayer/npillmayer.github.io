      <description>The other day I had reason to think about what actually comprises a typesetting stack. Typesetting allows the documents you compiled to be read on a output medium. For this post I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on screen-output.
Other have tried to give a systematic overview of what typesetting is. Nevertheless, I&amp;rsquo;ll jot down my own attempt, focussing on UAX, i.e. the Unicode recommendations and algorithms for various aspects of text segmentation.
A Walk through the Layout Process It&amp;rsquo;s clear that the rules of various Unicode annexes play an important role during typsetting.</description>

      <description>In the unlikely event of a software developer and a typographer attending the same party and—even more unlikely—enganging in some small talk, they certainly are prone to a fundamental disagreement: What is the nature of text? As an IT guy with a heavy interest in typography, I even find me in disagreement with myself, clearly an unhealthy state of mind. As a typographer I may think about beautiful books, fine typecases or craftsmanship in layout, as a bibliophile I may think about inspired literature or enlightened non-fiction, but as a programmer I mainly think of the hassle with UTF-8, emojis, limitations of string libaries and so on.</description>
