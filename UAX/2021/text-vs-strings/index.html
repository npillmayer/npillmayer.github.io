                <p>In the unlikely event of a software developer and a typographer attending the same party
and—even more unlikely—enganging in some small talk, they certainly are prone to a fundamental disagreement:
What is the nature of text? As an IT guy with a heavy interest in typography, I even find me in disagreement
with myself, clearly an unhealthy state of mind. As a typographer I may think about beautiful books,
fine typecases or craftsmanship in layout, as a bibliophile I may think about inspired literature or
enlightened non-fiction, but as a programmer I mainly think of the hassle with UTF-8, emojis, limitations
of string libaries and so on.</p>
<h2 id="texts-are-not-strings">Texts are not Strings</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m convinced programmers should stop talking about text as if it were just a
<a href="https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/87b416/difference-between-text-stream-string-and-binary-data/">long string</a>,
and vice
versa. In my opinion, text and strings are different animals, and the first step to having better
library support for texts is to recognize the difference.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/UAX/img/text-vs-string.png"
         alt="non-fiction text vs computer error message" width="400px"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>A single data type to rule them all?</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Text consists of letters and words, and so do strings. In real life we&rsquo;re accustomed to define things
by their components or their attributes. But in mathematics (and software development) we are
comfortable to define things by sets of operations on them.
Taking this perspective, smart people have
<a href="https://mortoray.com/2014/03/17/strings-and-text-are-not-the-same/">tried to work out the difference</a>
between text and strings or even
<a href="https://www.elastic.co/de/blog/strings-are-dead-long-live-strings">encode it in their application</a>,
but that won&rsquo;t stop me from pursuing my own attempt.</p>
<h3 id="similarities">Similarities</h3>
<p>Clearly strings are supposed to convey pieces of information. Presumably so do texts, but in a somewhat
broader sense. Software applications typically don&rsquo;t want to tell a story, but rather send me some
kind of concise message. There is obviously a grey area, and I do not intend to argue from this point of view.</p>
<p>Both texts and strings are composed from characters, and often from words. But already slight differences
start to creep in: <strong>What is a character?</strong> For texts, we think of a visual thing, more what&rsquo;s technically a
glyph, while with a string we&rsquo;re tempted to think <em>byte</em> or <em>uft16</em>. Unicode introduces programmers to
the term <em>grapheme</em> to mean a “perceived character”. This dilemma continues with the precise meaning of
what a “word” is: in computer science the term is heavily overloaded, and in the real world… it&rsquo;s
<a href="http://www.thai-language.com/ref/breaking-words">complicated</a>.
Higher-level building blocks of texts do not have sensible meaning for strings at all: sentences,
paragraphs, pages, etc. My impression is that many programmers insist on strings having <em>directly
addressable</em> characters, something along the lines of</p>
<pre><code>dest_string[i] = source_string[j]
</code></pre>
<p>but these times are gone forever. Accessing graphemes in text is an inherently sequential operation,
which is perfectly expressed by
<a href="https://docs.rs/unicode-segmentation/1.6.0/unicode_segmentation/index.html">Rust&rsquo;s unicode_segmentation crate</a>,
but other languages may
prefer to mask this, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/string#overview">as Swift does</a>.
For international text, fixed sized string cells are an illusion.</p>
<h3 id="different-operations">Different Operations</h3>
<p>In search for operations on text we could take a look at software applications dealing with text:
web browsers and word processors.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/UAX/img/office-and-browser.png"
         alt="Web browser window and Libre-Office window" width="400px"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>Taking text seriously</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>One of the reasons there are so few text-centric software libraries around may be that there is not much
demand for it. If you do not find yourself in a spot to program a web browser or are a contributor to
LibreOffice, you would probably be hard pressed to remember the last time you had to manipulate
large amounts of sentences and paragraphs in your software (with one exception, which I will talk
about in a minute). But perhaps the reverse is also true: there is a huge gap between the “professional
text machines” and everyday applications because there are so few tools for text around.</p>
<p>The following (mental) exercise helps me to address this: <strong>Why are you not programming a web browser?</strong>
Of course there are these minor complications with a cumbersome protocol, all kinds of security concerns,
an API and virtual machine for a weird scripting language, platform-dependent issues with a host of
media types, insanely complicated standards (which your peers prefer to interpret to their liking),
restrictions of hand-held devices, and a lot more. But apart from these, what makes it
hard to come up at least with a
<a href="https://www.brow.sh/">non-graphical browser</a>?*</p>
<p>Image you are handed a library for your preferred programming language which addresses the following
tasks linked to your brand-new browser project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow entities of text to be split, merged, extracted, reordered, etc. with ease,</li>
<li>those entities being (at least) code-points, graphemes, syllables, words, sentences, lines, paragraphs, etc.</li>
<li>Arbitrary runs of characters within these entities may be attributed (a.k.a. <em>styled</em>),
with synchronization of raw text and styles being transparent.</li>
<li>International text attributes (e.g., bidrectional text) are identified with easy and functions for
correct visual ordering are available</li>
<li>and are transparently intertwined with sophisticated line-breaking for a multitude of languages and scripts.</li>
<li>At least Unicode recommendations UAX#9 (bidi), UAX#11 (grapheme width), UAX#14 (line breaking), UAX#29 (entities
of text), UAX#51 (emojis) are available as actionable library functions.</li>
<li>Runs of text may be filled into containers, i.e. boxes on a page.</li>
<li>And performance won&rsquo;t degenerate in the face of large amounts of text.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a real web browser that would still leave you with
<a href="https://gankra.github.io/blah/text-hates-you/">tough problems</a>
of online-typography, but that&rsquo;s been the reason we will stick to a text-based browser in the first place.
But armed with this super-duper library you now are free to focus on implementing
<a href="http://book.mixu.net/css/index.html">a billion layout rules</a> and
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/all-properties.en.html">a zillion properties</a>, which—you keep repeating
to yourself—is the
<a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/08/inside-a-super-fast-css-engine-quantum-css-aka-stylo/">fun part of writing a browser</a>.</p>
<h3 id="just-for-the-pros">Just for the Pros?</h3>
<p>The list above may be daunting. Who would take it on her to implement all this? Actually the community
already did! In fact, some modules at the heart of browser
<a href="https://harfbuzz.github.io/">styling engines are community projects</a>.
Every now and then some brave person tackles one of these challenges and with some luck the code ends up
in a library, instead of a monolitic application.</p>
<p>Unfortunately all this code (and knowledge) is distributed in different applications and libraries,
implemented in different programming languages. Attempts to integrate these into a
<a href="https://sile-typesetter.org/">text processing engine</a>
are heroic, but may be of limited benefit to the software development community.</p>
<h3 id="text-is-not-a-sequence-of-bytes">Text is not a Sequence of Bytes</h3>
<p>Strings are sequences of bytes. We may overlay these bytes with semantics by using an encoding, but
the sequential nature of byte sequences persists. But is this the appropriate tool for managing text?
RAM is cheap and copying blocks of data is very fast these days, but I am unsure if byte sequences are
the best data structure for text. Real world text engines do not represent text as byte sequences, but
more often than not as trees. XML underlies the engines of web browsers (HTML) as well as word
processors (ODF, DOCX), and is inherently a tree-like format.</p>
<p>Perhaps tree-structure and byte-sequence should meet at the paragraph level: Although modern literature
has produced some really looong paragraphs, usually they provide a good synchronisation point for
sequenctial operations like iterating graphemes, breaking lines, bidi-ordering etc. If we are
able to quickly access paragraphs in large texts (possibly employing concurrency), we could then
treat paragraphs as sequential work packages.</p>
<p>Trees are also easily implemented as persistent data structures, a bonus with multithreading.
Some editors use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_%28data_structure%29">ropes</a> as their underlying
data structure, which may be a good basis for other text manipulation purposes.</p>
<h2 id="what-text-is-not">What Text is not</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s a telltale that text tenaciously escapes exact definitions: We humans utilize it for
all kinds of activities and often it&rsquo;s easier to tell what a text library should <em>not</em> include.</p>
<h3 id="text-vs-typography">Text vs Typography</h3>
<p>While on one end of the spectrum a data type for text has to have distinct semantics different from strings,
on the other end we should be careful with where typography starts. Obviously there is a grey area, too,
but we may at least
<a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/text/2020/10/26/text-layout.html">try to categorize</a>.</p>
<p>It is not a matter of macroscopic vs microscopic view, as typography ranges from pixels on a output device
to the layout of a book, but rather with having completely different logical entities. Typography is
concerned with the <strong>visual representation</strong> of text. That&rsquo;s it. This includes fonts, hyphenation,
page layout, international scripts etc.</p>
<p>But just a second ago this guy talked about styled text, you ask? And you&rsquo;re right.
A word in italics is about visual representation, but it is also about semantics.
In HTML lingo this is called <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> (emphasize). The line is blurry—welcome to the world of human communication!</p>
<h3 id="text-as-data">Text as Data</h3>
<p>The one instance above where I alluded to a frequent text use case is with text primarily treated as data.
Of course, that sounds strange in a blog post about text processing on a computer, but I&rsquo;ll put
machine learning, full text search etc. in this camp.
For now I will not think about inverted indexes, PoS-tagging or n-grams as part of a text-API.
But who knows what a web browser in 2030 will be capable of?</p>
